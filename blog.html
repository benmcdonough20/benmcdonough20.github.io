                Here is a curious fact about the operator norm of the truncation of a matrix to the lower-left-triangle! This is based off an <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2589115?seq=1" class="tl">article</a> by Rajendra Bhatia that I would recommend reading.

                    I am happy to report that I was a recipient of the FY 2025 NDSEG fellowship to support my research in quantum information dynamics! Although I found being a TA deeply fulfilling, I am excited for the opportunity to focus on research and looking forward to what we will uncover through this interesting new perspective on quantum dynamics in locally interacting quantum matter and the information processing capacity of quantum devices. If you are a prospective applicant, you can find my application materials attached!

                 This blog post lays out the two-projections theorem, which provides an underlying understanding of distance metrics between linear subspaces, particularly in the context of perturbation theory.

                       I was inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11242" class = "tl">this paper</a> by Chao Yin to learn about the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which shows up in all sorts of areas of physics.

               Welcome to my blog! I would like to use this as a place to organize my independent learning about physics and math as well as share tips from configuring/theming my Linux setup.
